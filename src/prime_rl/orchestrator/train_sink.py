"""TrainSink: three-level rollout sink for the training side.

1. ``process_rollout`` — eager per-rollout tokenization (overlaps with
   dispatcher producing more rollouts), then the env algorithm's
   ``finalize_rollout`` (rollout-local scoring + any reference I/O). Errored
   and untrainable rollouts skip this.
2. ``process_group`` — filters errored rollouts, hands the trainable
   survivors to the env algorithm's ``finalize_group`` (advantages +
   per-sample wire stamping), runs the pre-batch filter pass.
3. ``process_batch`` — applies post-batch filter annotations and assembles
   the trainer-bound ``TrainingSample`` list. Returns a ``TrainBatch``.

``add()`` takes one episode (``list[Rollout]``) and returns
``TrainBatch | None``; group accounting counts episodes, never loose traces.
I/O concerns (ship to trainer, save_rollouts, monitor.log) live on the
orchestrator.
